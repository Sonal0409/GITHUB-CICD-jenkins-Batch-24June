Agenda:
=============
Discuss on Traditional SDLC model
Overview on DevOps and its tools
Explain about DevOps Principles and lifecycle
Introduction to DevSecOps and its Lifecycle
Difference between DevOps and DecSecOps pipeline


DevOps 
-> Communication and collaboration between Dev and Ops team
-> Main goal is to deliver software quickly and efficiently
-> focus delivery aspect of the application.

Though the delivery is faster but the application has to be secure and free of vulnerabilities to cyber attacks

Dev+ Sec + Ops:
=============
It is an approach to software development that focuses on integration of security practices in DevOps process

security Testing -> will provide us evidences or reports that our system is safe and reliable

focuses on :
=================
executing activates that can damage the app or infrastructure which in furture can be exploited by the attacker
identify riks that can impact the application working
Finding solutions to issues related to security of application

OWSAP : is an open source organization that provides us guidelines on security scan that have to done to save our product form cyber attack


1. Software Composition Analysis + SBOM (Software bill of material)

SBOM : list of all software components , libraries and its versions that are included by the developer in order to write code for the application

SBOM will consist of list of custom code written by user/developer and the third party(open source code) code which is used to build complete application

The purpose of SBOM is to provide complete and accurate inventory of all the libraries and components that are used to make the software code

Software Composition Analysis(SCA):

SCA is a process in which we will use  tool that will scan you code for identifying and analyzing third party library error 

Tools: snyk, Veracode, blackDuck, OWASP dependency check



2. SAST : Static application security testing:
=================================
To find programming mistakes done by developer
To find complexity in the code
Copy mistakes done by developers
Hard coded password or username or token in code

Tools: checkmarx, fortify source, fortify on Demand, sonalqube, veracode


3. DAST : Dynamic Application Security testing

This testing is performed once application has been developed and deployed 

IN DAST we send various inputs to the application and its system to observe its response and see if it is able to handle vunerabilites. throw error messages

Tools: WebInspect, OWASP ZAP, Veracode DAST, burp professional
